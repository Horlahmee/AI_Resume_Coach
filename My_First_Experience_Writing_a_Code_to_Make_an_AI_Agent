My First Experience Writing a Code to Make an AI Agent
Ah, where do I begin? This journey started when I decided to take on the challenge of creating my very own AI agent. It wasn’t just any AI — it was going to be an assistant that could help people craft resumes, give career advice, and offer personalized skill recommendations. I wasn’t just writing code. I was crafting a virtual assistant, and, trust me, it was a wild and fun ride!
It all began with the idea. I had to set up the environment and lay out the framework for what would eventually become 'ResumeGenie.' The first thing on the agenda was setting up a GitHub repository. Now, I had never used GitHub that much before, but it didn’t take long to realize that it’s one of those must-know tools for any developer. I created a repository, and then it was time to set up my local development environment. Enter Python and the world of coding magic!
With the environment set up, I was ready to dive into the actual coding. I spent a lot of time working with Python, reading up on libraries, and understanding how to interact with an AI model. I used a tool called 'Ollama' to communicate with a model called Mistral, which would power my assistant. The AI part was tricky. I had to make sure it could handle a wide variety of questions and give smart, useful answers. In essence, I was teaching it to be an AI version of a career counselor, resume expert, and skill mentor.
Once the core logic was in place, I wanted to make the AI more interactive and user-friendly. I integrated a command-line interface (CLI), where users could input questions and get answers back. The AI would also log these prompts and responses so that users could come back to them later. It felt like building a relationship with this assistant as it started to remember its past interactions!
As I moved forward, I realized that the command-line interface, while functional, could only take me so far. That’s when I decided to give my project a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter. I spent some time learning how to use Tkinter and design a simple window where users could interact with ResumeGenie. I added buttons to clear text, view saved prompts, and even delete them. The result? A much more polished and user-friendly experience.
The real magic came when I started adding features to save and retrieve prompts and responses. I built the functionality so users could save their questions and the AI’s answers. This made the assistant even more useful. Imagine asking ResumeGenie for resume tips, saving the advice, and returning to it later. It felt like building something truly personalized!
Of course, no journey is without its bumps. There were moments when things didn’t work as expected. Errors appeared out of nowhere, and my code sometimes refused to cooperate. But with each challenge, I learned. I became more comfortable with debugging, testing, and improving my logic. The process became less intimidating and more of a puzzle to solve. One of the biggest hurdles was getting everything to work together — the AI response generation, saving prompts, the GUI... it was a lot to juggle. But in the end, I managed to pull it all together.
When I felt like the project was ready, I decided to push my code to GitHub. I’d read about version control, but now I was using it! I created a repository, pushed my code, and shared it with the world. It was an exciting moment. The project that I had been building from the ground up was finally on the cloud, available for anyone to see. It felt like a sense of accomplishment — like a digital high-five to myself!
Looking back at the journey, it’s been an amazing learning experience. I’ve come to realize that building an AI assistant is not just about coding; it’s about creating something that’s both functional and user-friendly. It’s about thinking through every detail, testing constantly, and pushing through the challenges. This is just the beginning of my journey in AI development, and I’m excited to see where it takes me next!
